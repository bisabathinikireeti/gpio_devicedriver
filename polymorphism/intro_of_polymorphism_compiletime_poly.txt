🔹 What is Polymorphism?

Poly = many
Morphism = forms

👉 So, Polymorphism means “many forms.”

In C++, it means:

The same name (function or operator) can behave differently in different situations.

🔹 Types of Polymorphism in C++

There are mainly two types:

Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static / Early Binding)

Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic / Late Binding)

Your example is about Compile-Time Polymorphism, so let’s focus on that.

✅ 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism

Here, the decision is made at compile time (before program runs).

The compiler decides:

Which function to call

Based on number or type of arguments

It is achieved using:

✔ Function Overloading

✔ Operator Overloading

🔹 A. Function Overloading
👉 What is Function Overloading?

When:

Two or more functions

Have the same name

But different parameters

That is called Function Overloading.

You can overload by:

Changing number of arguments

Changing type of arguments

🔹 Now Let’s Understand Your Code
class Geeks {
public:
    
    void add(int a, int b) {
        cout << "Integer Sum = " << a + b << endl;
    }
    
    void add(double a, double b) {
        cout << "Float Sum = " << a + b << endl;
    }
};

Here:

We have two functions with same name → add()

But difference is:

Function	Parameter Type
add(int, int)	Integer values
add(double, double)	Decimal values

So this is Function Overloading.

🔹 What Happens in main()?
Geeks gfg;

gfg.add(10, 2);

Here:

10 and 2 are integers

So compiler calls:

void add(int a, int b)

Output:

Integer Sum = 12

Next:

gfg.add(5.3, 6.2);

Here:

5.3 and 6.2 are double values

So compiler calls:

void add(double a, double b)

Output:

Float Sum = 11.5
🔹 Why is this Compile-Time Polymorphism?

Because:

👉 The compiler decides which function to call before execution
👉 It checks argument types during compilation

No confusion at runtime.

🔹 Simple Real-Life Example

Think of a calculator:

If you enter 2 and 3 → it does integer addition

If you enter 2.5 and 3.7 → it does decimal addition

Same button (+)
Different behavior depending on input

That is Polymorphism.

🔹 Important Rule

You cannot overload only by changing return type.

❌ Wrong:

int add(int a, int b);
double add(int a, int b);

Because parameters are same → compiler gets confused.

🔹 Short Summary (Easy Revision)

✔ Polymorphism = One name, many forms
✔ Compile-time polymorphism = Decided at compile time
✔ Achieved using:

Function overloading

Operator overloading
✔ Function overloading = Same function name, different parameters



function overloading
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Geeks {
public:
    
    // Function to add two integers
    void add(int a, int b) {
        cout << "Integer Sum = " << a + b
        << endl;
    }
    
    // Function to add two floating point values
    void add(double a, double b) {
        cout << "Float Sum = " << a + b
        << endl ;
    }
};

int main() {
    Geeks gfg;
    
    // add() called with int values
    gfg.add(10, 2);

    // add() called with double value
    gfg.add(5.3, 6.2);

    return 0;
}
